Question: Will every LAMS sequence have graded embedded quiz?
Answer: No. There will be some LAMS sequences that do not have any embedded quiz. There will also be some LAMS sequences with embedded questions to think about the content of the lecture, but not graded. This will be clearly stated for each LAMS, so that you know if a LAMS will contribute towards your grade.
